## **PROJECT TITLE**
Live Barcode and QR Code Reader

## **INTRODUCTION**
In this tutorial we will be performing a QR/Barcode scanner task which detects, scans and saves link in the `.txt` file. This task will be performed in the local enviornment.

## **PURPOSE**
I think QR/Barcodes are very cool and interesting because they store information in a different format. The fun part about them is we can’t really tell what they are storing until we scan them. **I did install all the required packages through `Git Bash` and edited the code the `visual Studio Code` and ran the `.py` file in `Git Bash` again.**

## **BRIEF EXPLANATION**
If you are wondering how barcode and QR code readers work, let’s do a quick real-life practice. Turn on your phone’s camera and show the featured image of this article. You will see a link show up, it’s very simple to use. Today, we will create our own reader, without losing any time let’s get started! 

## `Project`

 ## **CONCLUSION**

Congrats!! You have created a program the reads barcodes and QR codes for you. Now, you have an idea of how to use computer vision and artificial intelligence in the real life. Working on hands-on programming projects like this one is the best way to sharpen your coding skills. I would be glad if you learned something new today.
